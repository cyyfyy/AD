***Mechanics***
	-Critical Stats:
		- party support (this is % of population that supports you 0 Sum)
		- party funds
		
	-Each turn you may introduce a bill onto the parliment floor
		+ A Bill on the Floor
			- things a bill can do:
				* fund the galactic army from the coffers of the parties (a single party or many)
				* draft troops into the army from the given party.
				* enact propaganda for a party, or the galactic empire as a whole
				* decreade/increase taxes
				* adjust the way taxes are collected
				... these are the mechanics that make it interesting. Lets use US polotics as our insperation
	- If a bill was introduced you may vote to pass the bill
	
	- If the bill fails anyone may modify the bill
		+ all modifications are viewed live and locked when the round closes
			- this makes it a valid stratagy to sneak somthing in last minute
	
	- If you dont vote on a bill it is treated as an abstain
	
	- each turn you may spend money inorder to gain support
	
	- you may also spend the round campaining doing nothing in parlament all votes are abstained but gain support for next round
	
	- Voting power is dictated by the amount of support the party has
	
		

	- Quantum Move (Nope cool idea but not in this game)
		- Charged move 
		- Make a probalistic move, splitting you into two diffrent locations. If an evaluation weather or not a unit is there the location is collapsed.

***Themes***

	-Political/Diplomatic focus instead of battle focus?
	-You are a party of the galactic parlament. 
	-You pass legislation that is enacted for the good of the empire and for the good of you constituanits.
