***Mechanics***
	-Critical Stats:
		- party support (this is % of population that supports you 0 Sum)
		- party funds
		
	-Each turn you may introduce a bill onto the parliament floor
		+ A Bill on the Floor
			- things a bill can do:
				* fund the galactic army from the coffers of the parties (a single party or many)
				* draft troops into the army from the given party.
				* enact propaganda for a party, or the galactic empire as a whole
				* decrease/increase taxes
				* adjust the way taxes are collected
				... these are the mechanics that make it interesting. Lets use US politics as our inspiration
	- If a bill was introduced you may vote to pass the bill
	
	- If the bill fails anyone may modify the bill
		+ all modifications are viewed live and locked when the round closes
			- this makes it a valid strategy to sneak something in last minute
	
	- If you don't vote on a bill it is treated as an abstain
	
	- each turn you may spend money inorder to gain support
	
	- you may also spend the round campaigning doing nothing in parliament all votes are abstained but gain support for next round
	
	- Voting power is dictated by the amount of support the party has
	
		

	- Quantum Move (Nope cool idea but not in this game)
		- Charged move 
		- Make a probabilistic move, splitting you into two different locations. If an evaluation weather or not a unit is there the location is collapsed.

***Themes***
	-Space Colonization?
	-Political/Diplomatic focus instead of battle focus?
	-You are a party of the galactic parliament.
	-You pass legislation that is enacted for the good of the empire and for the good of you constituents.
	



***Some thoughts***
A few ideas: each player is a region or faction within a kingdom
each faction has 4 estates (types of actor)
Nobles
Clergy
Burgess
Peasants

Each turn players must decide what each actor group in their region is doing
e.g. taking an action or actions
Example actions:
Noble actors COULD negotiate with foreign powers, make laws, levy taxes, marry each other, start skirmishes, levy militias, fight as knights
Clergy actors COULD spread religion, spy on other actors, convert enemies (or allies), increase local happiness, increase education/science, communicate with the pope, collect church taxes
Burgess actors COULD produce goods, add economic activity, trade with other regions or foreign powers, move logistical resources
Peasants actors COULD produce food, produce simple goods, fight wars/skirmishes

Each player has to help maintain the overall stability of the country, but only one player can win
The king kind of adds a random element to the game, seemingly changing rules and priorities on a whim
The king could have some sort of council close to him, that starts the game with equal representation from each faction
e.g. a council of 8 for a 4 player game -- 2 from each player
As the game progresses, taking certain actions can help garner (garner garner) influence or curry favor with the king
potentially gaining or losing seats on the council
If a player ever has a majority of the seats on the council they win e.g. 5/8 in the example game above

Alternatively, each player could take on the role of one of the estates e.g. one player is the nobles
